# traits.build 1.0.0

This is the first major release of the {traits.build} package, providing a workflow to harmonise trait data from diverse sources. The code was originally built to support AusTraits (see Falster et al 2021, <doi:10.1038/s41597-021-01006-6>, <https://github.com/traitecoevo/autraits.build>) and has been generalised here to support construction of other trait databases.
