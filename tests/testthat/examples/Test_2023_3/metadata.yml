  description: Plant growth form data extracted from the NT Flora Online
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the PlantNet online flora (version
    date 2022-05-06). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon were downloaded
    and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names and their corresponding
    text using R coding script. Sentences and phrases were categorised using a large
    glossary of botanical terminology as referring to one of the following, the entire
    organism, stem, leaf, flower, fruit/seed, roots and environment/habitat. Key terms
    corresponding to trait values in AusTraits were then extracted from these smaller
    chunks of text using a reference table containing a) the AusTraits trait name,
    b) the AusTraits trait value and c) terms to search for in the text. The resulting
    traits were then checked manually using a subset of ~500 taxa to search for errors
    and update the reference table and coding script accordingly. The process was
    repeated iteratively to remove any wrongly classified trait values and to ensure
    as many correct trait values as possible were captured using the algorithm. Where
    possible, unclassified taxa were inferred as possessing a trait value from a higher-level
    taxonomic description e.g. the fruit type of all taxa in the Adenanthos genus
    were scored as `achene`, which was mentioned only in the genus description.

  entity_type: species
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  value_type: mean

  methods: When specified in the taxon description, only the colours of the fruit
    at maturity or the dominant colours of the fruit exterior were scored. If neither
    were specified, all colours associated with the fruit were scored.

  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fruit_dehiscence
  entity_type: species
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  value_type: mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Taxa were scored as dehiscent from a variety of terms in the text including
    the kind of dehiscence e.g. scepticidal, loculicidal or possessing valves.

  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: fruit_length
  entity_type: species
  basis_of_value: measurement
  value_type: mean
  replicates: '3'
  methods: The term used to describe the fruit length was stored  as a measurement
    remark for greater clarity e.g. fruit, achene, capsule. Fruits which were spherical
    or round in shape were inferred as possessing the same dimensions in other planes.

  trait_name: fruit_width
  entity_type: species
  basis_of_value: measurement

  methods: Minimum fruit width; the term used to describe the fruit width was stored as
    a measurement remark for greater clarity e.g. fruit, achene, capsule. Fruits which
    were spherical or round in shape were inferred as possessing the same dimensions in
    other planes.

  entity_type: species

  methods: Maximum fruit width; the term used to describe the fruit width was stored as
    a measurement remark for greater clarity e.g. fruit, achene, capsule. Fruits which
    were spherical or round in shape were inferred as possessing the same dimensions in
    other planes.
