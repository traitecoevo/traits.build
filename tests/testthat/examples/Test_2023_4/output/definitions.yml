  label: Fruit length
  description: A fruit morphology trait [TO:0002629] which is the length [PATO:0000122]
    of a fresh [EnvThes:21976] fruit [PO:0009001] from the fruit proximal end [PO:0008002]
    (base) to the fruit distal end [PO:0008001] (apex).;Linear dimension from the
    base to the apex of a fresh fruit, even if this is not the longest dimension.

fruit_width:
  label: Fruit width
  description: A fruit morphology trait [TO:0002629] which is the width [PATO:0000921]
    of a fresh [EnvThes:21976] fruit [PO:0009001], where width is the greatest linear
    dimension [PATO:0001708] perpendicular to [PATO:0002434] to the fruit length [PATO:0000122]
    and fruit height [PATO:0000119].;Greatest linear width dimension of a fresh fruit,
    sometimes referred to as 'diameter' in fruits where the width and height are identical;
    orthogonal to the fruit length, the base-to-apex dimension.

fruit_dehiscence:
  label: Fruit dehiscence
  description: A fruit morphology trait [TO:0002629] which indicates whether mature
    [PATO:0001701] fruits [PO:0009001] are dehiscent [GO:0009900].;Binary variable,
    dividing fruits into 'dehiscent' versus 'indehiscent' based on whether the individual
    fruit units are dehiscent when mature.
  type: categorical
  allowed_values_levels:
    dehiscent: Fruits are dehiscent when mature.
    indehiscent: Fruits are indehiscent when mature.

    [PO:0009001].;Human visible dominant colour of a fresh fruit's exocarp (outermost
    layer) at maturity.
