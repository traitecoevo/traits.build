Test_2023_4,fruit_colour,"When specified in the taxon description, only the colours of the fruit at maturity or the dominant colours of the fruit exterior were scored. If neither were specified, all colours associated with the fruit were scored.",01,Plant growth form data extracted from the NT Flora Online,"This dataset is sourced from the PlantNet online flora (version date 2022-05-06). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences and phrases were categorised using a large glossary of botanical terminology as referring to one of the following, the entire organism, stem, leaf, flower, fruit/seed, roots and environment/habitat. Key terms corresponding to trait values in AusTraits were then extracted from these smaller chunks of text using a reference table containing a) the AusTraits trait name, b) the AusTraits trait value and c) terms to search for in the text. The resulting traits were then checked manually using a subset of ~500 taxa to search for errors and update the reference table and coding script accordingly. The process was repeated iteratively to remove any wrongly classified trait values and to ensure as many correct trait values as possible were captured using the algorithm. Where possible, unclassified taxa were inferred as possessing a trait value from a higher-level taxonomic description e.g. the fruit type of all taxa in the Adenanthos genus were scored as `achene`, which was mentioned only in the genus description.",NHNSW_2023,"N.
