# Test Dataset 5: `Test_2023_5`

This dataset is for testing:
- `individual_id` for wide datasets
- Different `bibtype`s and secondary and original sources (also check methods table), with `source_id` column (check joining to methods table somewhere else?)
- No locations or contexts

Test_2023_5 is a copy of Falster_2005_1 with the following modifications:
- Added all `bibtype` options to the dataset via secondary/original sources
