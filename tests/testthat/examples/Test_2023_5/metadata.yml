  additional_traits: Birk_1992 - has all reported values for nutrient addition treatments
    as well; Feller - has root nutrient values for 2 species; Hopmans_1993 - additional
    micronutrient data for wood and bark; Leigh_2003 - gas exchange data in chart,
    if we get hold of the author; Leigh_2006 - lots of additional data if we contact
