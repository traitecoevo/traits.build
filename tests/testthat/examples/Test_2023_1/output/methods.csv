After removing bark material, the volume of each wood sample was determined using Archimedes' principle (Hacke et al. 2000). Samples were submerged in a water-filled container on a balance. The weight change (mg) recorded during submersion corresponds to the mass of water displaced, which can be converted to a volume using the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998 (mg/mm3), where 0.998 mg/mm3 is the density of water at 20 deg C.

Test_2023_1,huber_value,"Leaf area was determined for a shoot whose sapwood had a cross sectional area of 10 mm2. In detail from Wright_2006, which used this data, No single best point exists to compare traits such as LM/ SM, LA/SM and LA/SA when considering a set of species that varies widely in canopy architecture and typical maximum height (here, approximately 20 cm to 85 m). We have used several approaches (Table 1). In one study, we made measurements on the terminal twigs of each species, i.e. on a relatively standard developmental unit (Westoby and Wright 2003). For species at Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF, traits were measured at each of several different distances back down the stem from the branch tip (Falster and Westoby 2005a, 2005b and unpublished, Pickup et al. 2005). At GHP, RHM and RHW, traits were measured at a standard sapwood cross-sectional area (10 mm2; Pickup et al. 2005). For the present re-analysis, we took the raw data from the previous studies and, for every species possible, calculated patterns of leaf and stem deployment at two standard points: at 250 mm distance from the branch tip (Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF) and at 10 mm2 stem (Ash, Myall, TRF) or sapwood (GHP, GLP, RHM, RHW) crosssectional area (250 mm or 10 mm2 formulation denoted as subscript in trait abbreviations). This was done as follows. For each individual plant, total leaf and stem dry mass at 250 mm distance was estimated by straightline interpolation from values measured at the nearest sampling points on either side of this distance. As the dry mass data tended to display non-linear (power) relationships with distance from the branch tip, the interpolated values were calculated from log10-log10- transformed data, then back-transformed to the original scale. The same approach was used for interpolating data to the standard stem (or sapwood) cross-sectional area. For individuals where measurements had not been made on either side of the desired point but the nearest measurement had been made within 25 mm of 250 mm or 1 mm2 of 10 mm2 cross-section (i.e. within 10% of the desired point), we extrapolated (rather than interpolated) the measured data to the standard point. This allowed us to include a number of individuals and species for which interpolation was not possible. Still, several large-leaved, large-stemmed species from the TRF site could not be included in the 10-mm2 crosssection dataset. No unusual tendencies in analyses, including the extrapolated data, were seen in comparison to analyses including interpolated data only (details not shown). To illustrate how species' morphology varied at the two standard sampling points, species-mean stem cross-sectional area varied between 1.2 and 258 mm2 at 250 mm distance from the branch tip, while the distance from the branch tip at which stem cross-sectional area reached 10 mm2 varied from 64 to 995 mm.",01,Investigation into trait values correlated with plant height along light availability and successional gradients for far north Queensland species.,"Nineteen species, ranging from early to late successional status, were selected using published sources (Hopkins & Graham 1987; Osunkoya 1996; Hyland et al. 1999).
