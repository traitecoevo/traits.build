  sampling_strategy: Nineteen species, ranging from early to late successional status,
    were selected using published sources (Hopkins & Graham 1987; Osunkoya 1996; Hyland
    et al. 1999). Species selected to represent the light gradient establish and mature
    in closed forest, where successional species are assumed absent. For inclusion
    in this set we required that a species was known to establish and persist at low
    light levels, as indicated either by published sources (Hyland et al. 1999; Osunkoya
    1996) or by scientists familiar with the vegetation (A Graham, J Wells, CSIRO
    Atherton; R Jensen). Twenty-six species, experiencing a range of light levels
    at maturity, from high (canopy trees) to low light (understorey shrubs), were
    included.

traits:
- var_in: LMA (mg mm-2)
  unit_in: mg/mm2
  trait_name: leaf_mass_per_area
  basis_of_value: measurement
  value_type: mean
  methods: LMA was calculated as the leaf dry mass (oven-dried for 48 hours at 65
    deg C) divided by leaf size. It was measured on the first five fully expanded
    leaves at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: Leaf nitrogen (mg mg-1)
  unit_in: mg/mg
  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  basis_of_value: measurement
  value_type: mean
  methods: Leaves from all individuals per species were pooled and finely ground for
    nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen concentration (%) was measured using complete
    combustion gas chromatography by Waite Analytical Services, Adelaide. The first
    five fully expanded leaves at the tip of each individual were used for the analysis.
- var_in: leaf size (mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  basis_of_value: measurement
  value_type: mean
  methods: Leaf size was calculated as the one-sided leaf area (flat bed scanner).
    It was measured on the first five fully expanded leaves at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: wood density (mg mm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  basis_of_value: measurement
  value_type: mean
  methods: Wood density was calculated using 40-60 mm stem segments taken 250 mm and
    1000 mm back along a branch from the branch tip. Fresh samples were refrigerated
    before processing. After removing bark material, the volume of each wood sample
    was determined using Archimedes' principle (Hacke et al. 2000). Samples were submerged
    in a water-filled container on a balance. The weight change (mg) recorded during
    submersion corresponds to the mass of water displaced, which can be converted
    to a volume using the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998 (mg/mm3), where
    0.998 mg/mm3 is the density of water at 20 deg C. Samples were then dried for
    4 days at 60 deg C before weighing.
- var_in: branch mass fraction
  unit_in: mg/mg
  trait_name: .na
  basis_of_value: measurement
  value_type: mean
  methods: Branch mass fraction was calculated as the mass side branches/total mass,
    on a carbon dry mass basis. The zero values are correct - these are plants with
    no branches.
- var_in: Seed mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_dry_mass
  basis_of_value: measurement
  value_type: mean
  methods: Mean oven-dried seed mass (including seed coat but excluding seed accessories)
    was estimated for all species with available field material. In total, collections
    for 17 of 47 species were made. Data for an additional 12 species were drawn from
    published (Osunkoya et al. 1994; Grubb et al. 1998) and unpublished (P. Juniper,
    CSIRO Atherton) sources.

  methods: 'Leaf area was determined for a shoot whose sapwood had a cross sectional
    area of 10 mm2. In detail from Wright_2006, which used this data, No single best
    point exists to compare traits such as LM/ SM, LA/SM and LA/SA when considering
    a set of species that varies widely in canopy architecture and typical maximum
    height (here, approximately 20 cm to 85 m). We have used several approaches (Table
    1). In one study, we made measurements on the terminal twigs of each species,
    i.e. on a relatively standard developmental unit (Westoby and Wright 2003). For
    species at Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF, traits were measured at each of several different
    distances back down the stem from the branch tip (Falster and Westoby 2005a, 2005b
    and unpublished, Pickup et al. 2005). At GHP, RHM and RHW, traits were measured
    at a standard sapwood cross-sectional area (10 mm2; Pickup et al. 2005). For the
    present re-analysis, we took the raw data from the previous studies and, for every
    species possible, calculated patterns of leaf and stem deployment at two standard
    points: at 250 mm distance from the branch tip (Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF) and at
    10 mm2 stem (Ash, Myall, TRF) or sapwood (GHP, GLP, RHM, RHW) crosssectional area
    (250 mm or 10 mm2 formulation denoted as subscript in trait abbreviations). This
    was done as follows. For each individual plant, total leaf and stem dry mass at
    250 mm distance was estimated by straightline interpolation from values measured
    at the nearest sampling points on either side of this distance. As the dry mass
    data tended to display non-linear (power) relationships with distance from the
    branch tip, the interpolated values were calculated from log10-log10- transformed
    data, then back-transformed to the original scale. The same approach was used
    for interpolating data to the standard stem (or sapwood) cross-sectional area.
    For individuals where measurements had not been made on either side of the desired
    point but the nearest measurement had been made within 25 mm of 250 mm or 1 mm2
    of 10 mm2 cross-section (i.e. within 10% of the desired point), we extrapolated
    (rather than interpolated) the measured data to the standard point. This allowed
    us to include a number of individuals and species for which interpolation was
    not possible. Still, several large-leaved, large-stemmed species from the TRF
    site could not be included in the 10-mm2 crosssection dataset. No unusual tendencies
    in analyses, including the extrapolated data, were seen in comparison to analyses
    including interpolated data only (details not shown). To illustrate how species''
    morphology varied at the two standard sampling points, species-mean stem cross-sectional
    area varied between 1.2 and 258 mm2 at 250 mm distance from the branch tip, while
    the distance from the branch tip at which stem cross-sectional area reached 10
    mm2 varied from 64 to 995 mm.'
