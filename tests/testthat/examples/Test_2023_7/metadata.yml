  description: Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related
    genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient
    in northern Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Leaf gas exchange measurements were made at six sites along a
    sub-continental rainfall gradient in northern Australia (Fig. 1). The sites covered
    a latitudinal range from approximately 12 deg S to 23 deg S, with corresponding
    MAP ranging from approximately 1700 mm to 300 mm (Table 1). Two canopy tree species
    characteristic of each site were selected for measurements. All of the selected
    species were from the genus Eucalyptus, or the closely related genus Corymbia
    (Table 1). Two individuals of each of the two species at each site were selected
    for measurements. A total of six leaves were sampled from each species at each
    site. Canopy access was achieved with a 16 m elevated work platform at the four
    more northerly sites, and with ladders or from the ground at the two more southerly
    sites where trees were shorter.
  original_file: Leaf trait data.xls (summary values imported into AusTraits) and
    Leaf gas exchange.xls (full light response and A-Ci curve data) in raw data folder
    and GoogleDrive folder
  notes: The few duplicate values within this dataset, and with Schmidt_2003, Schulze_1998,
    and Schulze_2006_2 seem to all be random, independent values since many measurements
    for the same traits were made on the same species.

  methods: The A-ci curves were analysed using the spreadsheet utility (version 2007.1)
    provided by Sharkey et al. (2007). The spreadsheet utility fits the photosynthesis
    model of Farquhar et al. (1980) to the observed CO2 response curve. Estimates
    are generated of the maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate, Vcmax (umol CO2 m-2 s-1);
    the electron transport rate, J (umol electrons m-2 s-1); triose phosphate use,
    TPU (umol triose phosphate m-2 s-1); day respiration, Rd (umol CO2 m-2 s-1); and
    mesophyll conductance to CO2, gm (umol m-2 s-1 Pa-1). The spreadsheet utility
    provides estimates of these parameters normalized to 25 deg C to facilitate comparisons
    with measurements made at other leaf temperatures. An additional column in the
    data.csv file, 'Vcmax atTleaf (umol m-2 s-1)', provides Vcmax values at the measured
    leaf temperature and the column 'Tleaf (deg C)' indicates the leaf temperatures
    during gas exchange measurements.
