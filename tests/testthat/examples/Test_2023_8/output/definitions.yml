leaf_area:
  label: Leaf area
  description: A leaf area trait [TO:0000540] which is the 2-D [PATO:0001709] area
    [PATO:0001323] of the leaf lamina [PO:0020039] and petiole [PO:0020038]. For some
    species the area of a leaf analogue is reported, possibly a leaflet [PO:0020049],
    cladode [PO:0025354], or phyllode [PO:0025335].;The 2-dimensional projected (scanned)
    area of the surface of a leaf or a leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, phyllode).
  comments: This trait includes measurements of leaves and leaf analogues, including
    leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
    the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as a
    `context` or under `measurement_remarks`. Leaflet area can alternatively be mapped
    to the trait `leaflet_area`. It is most common for leaf area measurements to include
    the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole is included
    in or excluded from the leaf area measurements. For terete leaves, leaf area should
    still be recorded as the 2-dimensional projected area.

  label: Leaf mass per area
  description: A leaf morphology trait [TO:0000748] which is the ratio [PATO:0001470]
    of the leaf dry [PATO:0001824] mass [PATO:0000125] to the leaf [PO:0025034] area
    [PATO:0001323], measured on an entire leaf, including the entire leaf lamina [PO:0020039]
    and the petiole [PO:0020038].;The ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area, measured
    on an entire leaf including the petiole; LMA. (The inverse of specific leaf area,
    SLA.)
  comments: Leaf mass per area includes measurements submitted as `specific_leaf_area`
    (SLA); they are simply inverted. Leaf mass per area is explicitly measured on
    an entire leaf, including the petiole. Measurements made on a piece of the leaf
    lamina, excluding petiole and midrib, are a separate trait `leaf_lamina_mass_per_area`.
    If measurements are made on the entire leaf lamina, but the petiole is excluded,
    this should be noted in the methods or under `measurement_remarks`.

seed_dry_mass:

  description: A seed morphology trait [TO:0000184] which is the dry [PATO:0001824]
    mass [PATO:0000125] of a mature [PATO:0001701] seed [PO:0009010].;Dry mass of
    a mature seed, including both oven dried and air-dried samples.
  comments: Standard methods people will have used to dry seeds include, 'fresh' (at
    dispersal, mature); 'air dried' (at local ambient conditions); 'seed bank air
    dried' (to 15% relative humidity); and 'oven dried' (>100 deg C for a set number
    of hours; e.g. seed bank standard is 103 deg C for 17 hours). It is expected that
    some observations in AusTraits mapped onto â€˜seed_dry_mass' will actually include
    both the seed and some dispersal tissue, if the two cannot easily be separated;
    these should be mapped to 'diaspore_dry_mass'.

plant_growth_form:
  label: Plant growth form
  description: A whole plant [PO:0000003] phenotype [NCIT:C16977] trait that summarises
    different components of a whole plant's shape [PATO:0000052] and structure [PATO:0000141]
    into general groups [NCIT:C43359]. Characters that contribute to the plant form
    categories include the height [PATO:0000119] of the vegetative shoot system [PO:0025607],
    the distribution of leaves [PO:0025034] along the plant stem [PO:0009047], and
    the position [PATO:0000140] and count [NCIT:C25463] of stems and/or leaves relative
    to the ground surface.;The form of a plant, capturing a general sense of plant
    height and shape, which parts of a plant are woody versus herbaceous, the number
    of stems arising at ground level, and the distribution of leaves relative to the
    main stem.
  comments: This definition of plant growth form is narrower than what is used by
    many other references. Here, information pertaining to where a plant grows is
    captured by `plant_growth_substrate`. Terminology about the shape and length of
    stems and distribution of leaves is included in `stem_growth_habit`. An indication
    of whether a plant is parasitic is presented in `parasitic`. Included in the list
    of plant growth forms are two terms that are exclusively used to describe Australian
    plants, mallee and hummock, and one, tussock, that is an important growth form
    of Australian grasses, but globally used less frequently.
  type: categorical
  allowed_values_levels:
    basal_large: A plant whose leaves form a distinctly large basal tuft or rosette,
      including large acaulescent monocots and cycads.
    climber: Plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches, rather than being
      able to support itself. Term used only if datasets do not specify if a climbing
      plant is herbaceous (a vine) or woody (a liana).
    climber_herbaceous: Herbaceous plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches,
      rather than being able to support itself. This is usually synonymous with `vine`.
      Types of climbers (scrambling, twining) are captured under the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`.
      (Synonyms, vine)
    climber_woody: Woody or thick-stemmed (>2 cm) plant that climbs up another plant's
      stem or branches, rather than being able to support itself. This is usually
      synonymous with `liana`. Woody climbers generally use hooks, tendrils, and/or
      adventitious roots to climb; the climbing mechanisms used by a taxon are captured
      under the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (Synonyms, liana)
    fern: A taxonomic grouping; ferns are vascular plants that reproduce via spores.
    geophyte: Subcategory of herb, specifically referring to plants that survive the
      winter/dry season as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm, or tuber) buried in dry
      soil, with all leaves dying back each year.
    graminoid: Herbaceous plant with a grass-like morphology that is within the order
      Poales. Taxa both with and without a tussock form are mapped to this term. This
      term is most frequently applied to three large monocot families, Poaceae, Cyperaceae,
      and Juncaceae, but the term could apply to other taxa within Poales with a grass-like
      morphology, including narrow, linear leaves and non-showy flowers, including
      Restionaceae, Centrolepidaceae, Anarthriaceae, and Ecdeiocoleaceae. Taxa outside
      Poales with a grass-like morphology should be designated as `herbs` and also
      have the term `tufted` mapped to the trait `stem_growth_habit`.
    graminoid_not_tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, indicating a plant which explicitly
      lacks a tussock morphology, with the leaves not growing in tufts.
    herb: A seed-bearing plant which does not have a woody above-ground stem; when
      available this term has been divided into more detailed terms. (Synonyms, forb)
    hummock: Plant that grows as a dense mound up to 1 metre in height. The term generally
      applies only to species within the genera Triodia that form such mounds and
      these are considered a distinctive and uniquely Australian growth form.
    lycophyte: A taxonomic grouping that includes quillworts, clubmosses, and selaginella.
    mallee: Refers to Eucalyptus species which are small trees that form a large lignotuber.
      They have multiple stems arising at or near ground level and regenerate from
      the lignotuber following fire.
    palmoid: Plant that bears a rosette-like canopy of typically large, often compound
      leaves atop a usually thick (pachycaulous), columnar, unbranched or little-branched
      stem. Palms, tree ferns, trunked cycads, trunked grass-trees, and Pandanus are
      mapped to this term. (Synonyms, rosette-tree, palm, grass-tree)
    shrub: A woody plant that is distinguished by NOT being a tree, due to one of
      more of the following characteristics, 1) they are less than 8 metres in height;
      2) if a plant community includes trees, the shrubs are shorter than the surrounding
      trees and not part of the canopy; 3) in comparison to trees, the leaves are
      more distributed along the entire trunk; 4) the plant has multiple relatively
      narrow stems arising at or near ground level. The definition of `shrub` is complex,
      as there are many single-stemmed shrubs within Australia and many taxa that
      are described in the taxonomic literature as a shrub or small tree.
    subshrub: A plant that is only woody at the base, with the remainder of the stems
      regenerating yearly. This term is not meant to encompass short-lived plants
      that are only borderline woody. (Synonyms, suffrutescent)
    tree: A tall, woody, perennial plant, usually with a single main trunk, and its
      leaves predominantly elevated above the ground surface.
    tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, which is a plant where many shoots from the
      basal meristem form prominent tufts.
