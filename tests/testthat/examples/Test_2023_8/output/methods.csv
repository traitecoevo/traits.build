Test_2023_8,leaf_photosynthesis,"The A-ci curves were analysed using the spreadsheet utility (version 2007.1) provided by Sharkey et al. (2007). The spreadsheet utility fits the photosynthesis model of Farquhar et al. (1980) to the observed CO2 response curve. Estimates are generated of the maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate, Vcmax (umol CO2 m-2 s-1); the electron transport rate, J (umol electrons m-2 s-1); triose phosphate use, TPU (umol triose phosphate m-2 s-1); day respiration, Rd (umol CO2 m-2 s-1); and mesophyll conductance to CO2, gm (umol m-2 s-1 Pa-1). The spreadsheet utility provides estimates of these parameters normalized to 25 deg C to facilitate comparisons with measurements made at other leaf temperatures. An additional column in the data.csv file, 'Vcmax atTleaf (umol m-2 s-1)', provides Vcmax values at the measured leaf temperature and the column 'Tleaf (deg C)' indicates the leaf temperatures during gas exchange measurements.",01,Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient in northern Australia.,"Leaf gas exchange measurements were made at six sites along a sub-continental rainfall gradient in northern Australia (Fig. 1). The sites covered a latitudinal range from approximately 12 deg S to 23 deg S, with corresponding MAP ranging from approximately 1700 mm to 300 mm (Table 1). Two canopy tree species characteristic of each site were selected for measurements. All of the selected species were from the genus Eucalyptus, or the closely related genus Corymbia (Table 1). Two individuals of each of the two species at each site were selected for measurements. A total of six leaves were sampled from each species at each site. Canopy access was achieved with a 16 m elevated work platform at the four more northerly sites, and with ladders or from the ground at the two more southerly sites where trees were shorter.",Test_2023_8,Article,"L.

Test_2023_8,leaf_stomatal_conductance,"Values used are from the first step of the A-ci curve, where CO2 was approximately 400 ppm and PAR 1200 umol m-2 s-1. In detail, two portable photosynthesis systems (Li-6400, LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) were used to measure the response of photosynthesis to intercellular CO2 concentration (A-ci curve) and to light (light response curve). The two systems were cross calibrated, and gave unbiased results with respect to each other. The measurement sequence for each sampled leaf started with the A-ci curve and then proceeded to the light response curve. The CO2 concentration (umol mol-1) entering the leaf gas exchange cuvette was altered in the following sequence: 400, 280, 230, 150, 70, 40, 230, 400, 640, 980, and 1200. A measurement of photosynthesis was logged approximately 2 min after each step change in CO2 concentration entering the cuvette. Irradiance during the A-ci curve measurements was set at 2000 umol photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) m-2 s-1, supplied by an artificial light source (6400-02B LED, LiCor Inc.). At the conclusion of the A-ci curve, the light response curve was measured on the same leaf. The CO2 concentration of air entering the cuvette was maintained at 1200 umol mol-1, and irradiance (umol PAR m-2 s-1) was altered in the following sequence: 2000, 1500, 1000, 500, 200, 120, 70, 40, 20, and 0. A measurement of photosynthesis was logged approximately 2 min after each step change in irradiance. We endeavoured to maintain the leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference (D) and the leaf temperature (T) constant across sites and within a site for each sample leaf during A-ci and light response measurements. The target D was 2.5 kPa and the target T was 33 deg C. Mean site values (mean +/- 1 SD) for T during measurements ranged from 32.3 +/- 0.6  deg C at the Howard Springs site to 33.9 +/- 2.0  deg C at the Boulia site. Mean site values during measurements for D ranged from 2.1 +/- 0.2 kPa at the Howard Springs site to 3.1 +/- 0.7 kPa at the Boulia site. Measurements at all sites except the Boulia site took place between 2 and 15 September 2008. Measurements at the Boulia site took place between 5 and 8 December 2008. Precipitation at the Boulia site does not show as highly pronounced a seasonal variation as the more northerly sites. A cumulative precipitation of 56 mm was recorded at the Boulia Airport in the nine months preceding the measurement campaign (http://www.bom.gov.au/index.shtml). Gas exchange measurements were taken between 0800 h and 1700 h local time at each site.",01,Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient in northern Australia.,"Leaf gas exchange measurements were made at six sites along a sub-continental rainfall gradient in northern Australia (Fig. 1).
