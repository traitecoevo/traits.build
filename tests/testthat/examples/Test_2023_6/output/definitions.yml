  label: Leaf mass per area
  description: A leaf morphology trait [TO:0000748] which is the ratio [PATO:0001470]
    of the leaf dry [PATO:0001824] mass [PATO:0000125] to the leaf [PO:0025034] area
    [PATO:0001323], measured on an entire leaf, including the entire leaf lamina [PO:0020039]
    and the petiole [PO:0020038].;The ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area, measured
    on an entire leaf including the petiole; LMA. (The inverse of specific leaf area,
    SLA.)
  comments: Leaf mass per area includes measurements submitted as `specific_leaf_area`
    (SLA); they are simply inverted. Leaf mass per area is explicitly measured on
    an entire leaf, including the petiole. Measurements made on a piece of the leaf
    lamina, excluding petiole and midrib, are a separate trait `leaf_lamina_mass_per_area`.
    If measurements are made on the entire leaf lamina, but the petiole is excluded,
    this should be noted in the methods or under `measurement_remarks`.

leaf_lifespan:
  label: Leaf lifespan
  description: The duration [PATO:0001309] that an individual leaf [PO:0025034] is
    attached to the stem [PO:0009047] and is physiologically functional [PATO:0001510].;Duration
    of time that an individual leaf is attached to the stem and physiologically functional;
    leaf longevity.
  comments: Leaf lifespan is the inverse of the rate of leaf turnover. For some species,
    leaflets or other portions of a leaf may be censused rather than the entire leaf
    lamina. Leaf lifespan can be censused as either the rate of shedding leaves (leaf
    death) or the rate of formation of new leaves (leaf birth).
