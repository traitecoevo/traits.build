leaf_area:
  label: Leaf area
  description: A leaf area trait [TO:0000540] which is the 2-D [PATO:0001709] area
    [PATO:0001323] of the leaf lamina [PO:0020039] and petiole [PO:0020038]. For some
    species the area of a leaf analogue is reported, possibly a leaflet [PO:0020049],
    cladode [PO:0025354], or phyllode [PO:0025335].;The 2-dimensional projected (scanned)
    area of the surface of a leaf or a leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, phyllode).
  comments: This trait includes measurements of leaves and leaf analogues, including
    leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
    the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as a
    `context` or under `measurement_remarks`. Leaflet area can alternatively be mapped
    to the trait `leaflet_area`. It is most common for leaf area measurements to include
    the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole is included
    in or excluded from the leaf area measurements. For terete leaves, leaf area should
    still be recorded as the 2-dimensional projected area.

leaf_mass_per_area:
  label: Leaf mass per area
  description: A leaf morphology trait [TO:0000748] which is the ratio [PATO:0001470]
    of the leaf dry [PATO:0001824] mass [PATO:0000125] to the leaf [PO:0025034] area
    [PATO:0001323], measured on an entire leaf, including the entire leaf lamina [PO:0020039]
    and the petiole [PO:0020038].;The ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area, measured
    on an entire leaf including the petiole; LMA. (The inverse of specific leaf area,
    SLA.)
  comments: Leaf mass per area includes measurements submitted as `specific_leaf_area`
    (SLA); they are simply inverted. Leaf mass per area is explicitly measured on
    an entire leaf, including the petiole. Measurements made on a piece of the leaf
    lamina, excluding petiole and midrib, are a separate trait `leaf_lamina_mass_per_area`.
    If measurements are made on the entire leaf lamina, but the petiole is excluded,
    this should be noted in the methods or under `measurement_remarks`.

seed_dry_mass:
  label: Seed dry mass
  description: A seed morphology trait [TO:0000184] which is the dry [PATO:0001824]
    mass [PATO:0000125] of a mature [PATO:0001701] seed [PO:0009010].;Dry mass of
    a mature seed, including both oven dried and air-dried samples.
  comments: Standard methods people will have used to dry seeds include, 'fresh' (at
    dispersal, mature); 'air dried' (at local ambient conditions); 'seed bank air
    dried' (to 15% relative humidity); and 'oven dried' (>100 deg C for a set number
    of hours; e.g. seed bank standard is 103 deg C for 17 hours). It is expected that
    some observations in AusTraits mapped onto â€˜seed_dry_mass' will actually include
    both the seed and some dispersal tissue, if the two cannot easily be separated;
    these should be mapped to 'diaspore_dry_mass'.
