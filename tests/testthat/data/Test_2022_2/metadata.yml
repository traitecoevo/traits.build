  description: Investigation into trait values correlated with plant height along
    light availability and successional gradients for far north Queensland species.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Nineteen species, ranging from early to late successional status,
    were selected using published sources (Hopkins & Graham 1987; Osunkoya 1996; Hyland
    et al. 1999). Species selected to represent the light gradient establish and mature
    in closed forest, where successional species are assumed absent. For inclusion
    in this set we required that a species was known to establish and persist at low
    light levels, as indicated either by published sources (Hyland et al. 1999; Osunkoya
    1996) or by scientists familiar with the vegetation (A Graham, J Wells, CSIRO
    Atherton; R Jensen). Twenty-six species, experiencing a range of light levels
    at maturity, from high (canopy trees) to low light (understorey shrubs), were
    included.
