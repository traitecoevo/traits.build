    leaf_area:
      label: Leaf area
      description: A leaf area trait [TO:0000540] which is the 2-D [PATO:0001709]
        area [PATO:0001323] of the leaf lamina [PO:0020039] and petiole [PO:0020038].
        For some species the area of a leaf analogue is reported, possibly a leaflet
        [PO:0020049], cladode [PO:0025354], or phyllode [PO:0025335].;The 2-dimensional
        projected (scanned) area of the surface of a leaf or a leaf analogue (leaflet,
        cladode, phyllode).
      comments: This trait includes measurements of leaves and leaf analogues, including
        leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
        the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as
        a `context` or under `measurement_remarks`. Leaflet area can alternatively
        be mapped to the trait `leaflet_area`. It is most common for leaf area measurements
        to include the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole
        is included in or excluded from the leaf area measurements. For terete leaves,
        leaf area should still be recorded as the 2-dimensional projected area.

        (leaf base [PO:0020040]).;Length of a leaf or a leaf analogue, from the leaf
        apex to the leaf axil (base), including the petiole.
      comments: If a leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, or phyllode) is measured instead
        of a true leaf, this should be noted as a `context` or under `measurement_remarks`.

    leaf_mass_per_area:
      label: Leaf mass per area
      description: A leaf morphology trait [TO:0000748] which is the ratio [PATO:0001470]
        of the leaf dry [PATO:0001824] mass [PATO:0000125] to the leaf [PO:0025034]
        area [PATO:0001323], measured on an entire leaf, including the entire leaf
        lamina [PO:0020039] and the petiole [PO:0020038].;The ratio of leaf dry mass
        to leaf area, measured on an entire leaf including the petiole; LMA. (The
        inverse of specific leaf area, SLA.)
      comments: Leaf mass per area includes measurements submitted as `specific_leaf_area`
        (SLA); they are simply inverted. Leaf mass per area is explicitly measured
        on an entire leaf, including the petiole. Measurements made on a piece of
        the leaf lamina, excluding petiole and midrib, are a separate trait `leaf_lamina_mass_per_area`.
        If measurements are made on the entire leaf lamina, but the petiole is excluded,
        this should be noted in the methods or under `measurement_remarks`.

    seed_dry_mass:
      label: Seed dry mass
      description: A seed morphology trait [TO:0000184] which is the dry [PATO:0001824]
        mass [PATO:0000125] of a mature [PATO:0001701] seed [PO:0009010].;Dry mass
        of a mature seed, including both oven dried and air-dried samples.
      comments: Standard methods people will have used to dry seeds include, 'fresh'
        (at dispersal, mature); 'air dried' (at local ambient conditions); 'seed bank
        air dried' (to 15% relative humidity); and 'oven dried' (>100 deg C for a
        set number of hours; e.g. seed bank standard is 103 deg C for 17 hours). It
        is expected that some observations in AusTraits mapped onto â€˜seed_dry_mass'
        will actually include both the seed and some dispersal tissue, if the two
        cannot easily be separated; these should be mapped to 'diaspore_dry_mass'.

    leaf_photosynthesis_Vcmax_per_area:
      label: Leaf Vcmax per unit leaf area (Vcmax)
      description: Maximum [NCIT:C25564] carboxylation [MOP:0000591] rate [PATO:0000161]
        by the Rubisco complex [GO:0048492] in plant leaves [PO:0025034], recorded
        per unit leaf [PO:0025034] area [PATO:0001323]. The value is a model parameter
        [STATO:0000034] derived from the initial slope of a photosynthesis [GO:0015979]
        A-ci response curve, the component that is carbon dioxide [CHEBI:16526] limited
        and hence limited by Rubisco activity.;The apparent maximum rate of Rubisco
        (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) activity carboxylase activity
        (carboxylation capacity), recorded per unit leaf dry mass. This is a model-derived
        value, calculated from the portion of an A-ci response curve (curve showing
        the photosynthetic response to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations) at
        low carbon dioxide concentrations. This is the portion of the curve where
        the photosynthetic rate is limited by the Rubisco activity.
      comments: This trait is explicitly for Vcmax per leaf area measurements made
        at a temperature other than 25 deg C. It is essential to record measurement
        temperature as a context property as Vcmax is very sensitive to changes in
        temperature. Measurements made at 25 deg C should be mapped to `leaf_photosynthesis_Vcmax_per_area_25C`

    plant_growth_form:
      label: Plant growth form
      description: A whole plant [PO:0000003] phenotype [NCIT:C16977] trait that summarises
        different components of a whole plant's shape [PATO:0000052] and structure
        [PATO:0000141] into general groups [NCIT:C43359]. Characters that contribute
        to the plant form categories include the height [PATO:0000119] of the vegetative
        shoot system [PO:0025607], the distribution of leaves [PO:0025034] along the
        plant stem [PO:0009047], and the position [PATO:0000140] and count [NCIT:C25463]
        of stems and/or leaves relative to the ground surface.;The form of a plant,
        capturing a general sense of plant height and shape, which parts of a plant
        are woody versus herbaceous, the number of stems arising at ground level,
        and the distribution of leaves relative to the main stem.
      comments: This definition of plant growth form is narrower than what is used
        by many other references. Here, information pertaining to where a plant grows
        is captured by `plant_growth_substrate`. Terminology about the shape and length
        of stems and distribution of leaves is included in `stem_growth_habit`. An
        indication of whether a plant is parasitic is presented in `parasitic`. Included
        in the list of plant growth forms are two terms that are exclusively used
        to describe Australian plants, mallee and hummock, and one, tussock, that
        is an important growth form of Australian grasses, but globally used less
        frequently.
      type: categorical
      allowed_values_levels:
        basal_large: A plant whose leaves form a distinctly large basal tuft or rosette,
          including large acaulescent monocots and cycads.
        climber: Plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches, rather than
          being able to support itself. Term used only if datasets do not specify
          if a climbing plant is herbaceous (a vine) or woody (a liana).
        climber_herbaceous: Herbaceous plant that climbs up another plant's stem or
          branches, rather than being able to support itself. This is usually synonymous
          with `vine`. Types of climbers (scrambling, twining) are captured under
          the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (Synonyms, vine)
        climber_woody: Woody or thick-stemmed (>2 cm) plant that climbs up another
          plant's stem or branches, rather than being able to support itself. This
          is usually synonymous with `liana`. Woody climbers generally use hooks,
          tendrils, and/or adventitious roots to climb; the climbing mechanisms used
          by a taxon are captured under the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (Synonyms,
          liana)
        fern: A taxonomic grouping; ferns are vascular plants that reproduce via spores.
        geophyte: Subcategory of herb, specifically referring to plants that survive
          the winter/dry season as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm, or tuber) buried
          in dry soil, with all leaves dying back each year.
        graminoid: Herbaceous plant with a grass-like morphology that is within the
          order Poales. Taxa both with and without a tussock form are mapped to this
          term. This term is most frequently applied to three large monocot families,
          Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, but the term could apply to other taxa
          within Poales with a grass-like morphology, including narrow, linear leaves
          and non-showy flowers, including Restionaceae, Centrolepidaceae, Anarthriaceae,
          and Ecdeiocoleaceae. Taxa outside Poales with a grass-like morphology should
          be designated as `herbs` and also have the term `tufted` mapped to the trait
          `stem_growth_habit`.
        graminoid_not_tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, indicating a plant which
          explicitly lacks a tussock morphology, with the leaves not growing in tufts.
        herb: A seed-bearing plant which does not have a woody above-ground stem;
          when available this term has been divided into more detailed terms. (Synonyms,
          forb)
        hummock: Plant that grows as a dense mound up to 1 metre in height. The term
          generally applies only to species within the genera Triodia that form such
          mounds and these are considered a distinctive and uniquely Australian growth
          form.
        lycophyte: A taxonomic grouping that includes quillworts, clubmosses, and
          selaginella.
        mallee: Refers to Eucalyptus species which are small trees that form a large
          lignotuber. They have multiple stems arising at or near ground level and
          regenerate from the lignotuber following fire.
        palmoid: Plant that bears a rosette-like canopy of typically large, often
          compound leaves atop a usually thick (pachycaulous), columnar, unbranched
          or little-branched stem. Palms, tree ferns, trunked cycads, trunked grass-trees,
          and Pandanus are mapped to this term. (Synonyms, rosette-tree, palm, grass-tree)
        shrub: A woody plant that is distinguished by NOT being a tree, due to one
          of more of the following characteristics, 1) they are less than 8 metres
          in height; 2) if a plant community includes trees, the shrubs are shorter
          than the surrounding trees and not part of the canopy; 3) in comparison
          to trees, the leaves are more distributed along the entire trunk; 4) the
          plant has multiple relatively narrow stems arising at or near ground level.
          The definition of `shrub` is complex, as there are many single-stemmed shrubs
          within Australia and many taxa that are described in the taxonomic literature
          as a shrub or small tree.
        subshrub: A plant that is only woody at the base, with the remainder of the
          stems regenerating yearly. This term is not meant to encompass short-lived
          plants that are only borderline woody. (Synonyms, suffrutescent)
        tree: A tall, woody, perennial plant, usually with a single main trunk, and
          its leaves predominantly elevated above the ground surface.
        tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, which is a plant where many shoots from
          the basal meristem form prominent tufts.
