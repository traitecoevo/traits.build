The context of an observation is given by other observations, implying that an observed entity (and specifically each corresponding measurement) contextualizes another observed entity (and its corresponding measurements). For example, an observation associated with a location may serve as context for an observation associated with an organism.

Integer values apply to count data (e.g. eggs per clutch).

Categorical traits should define a constrained set of factor levels, such as sex differences in wing morphology (both sexes winged, both sexes unwinged, only males winged, only females winged) or unconstrained entries such as color.
