oboe:Characteristic
    dcterms:description "A characteristic represents a property of an entity that can be measured (e.g., height, length, or color). A characteristic of an entity is observed through a measurement, which further asserts a value of the characteristic for the entity. A characteristic type (e.g., 'height') can be associated with many different entities, whereas an individual characteristic (a particular occurrence of the 'height' characteristic) is associated to exactly one entity."@en ;

oboe:Measurement
    dcterms:description "A measurement is an assertion that a characteristic of an entity had a particular value with respect to an observation event. A measurement is comprised of a characteristic, a value, a measurement standard, and a protocol. Measurements can also have precision as well as a description of the methods used. Measurements can encapsulate characteristics that were recorded, but not necessarily measured in a physical sense. For example, the name of a location and a taxon can be captured through measurements."@en ;

oboe:Observation
    dcterms:description "An observation is an assertion that an entity (e.g., biological organisms, geographic locations, or environmental features, among others) was observed by an observer. An observation primarily serves to group a set of measurements together into a single 'observation event'. Observations are often made within a broader context. The context of an observation is given by other observations, implying that an observed entity (and specifically each corresponding measurement) contextualizes another observed entity (and its corresponding measurements). For example, an observation associated with a location may serve as context for an observation associated with an organism. In this case, the observed characteristic values of the location (such as humidity) are assumed constant for the corresponding measurements of the organism."@en ;

oboe:hasContext
    dcterms:description "The hasContext property asserts that one observation serves as the context for another observation. In a hasContext property the domain is the observation being contextualized and the range is the context. Context defines a semantic relationship between two entities that is a fundamental aspect of the observations, but not necessarily of the entities themselves. For example, most measurements are accomplished in a spatio-temporal framework that might be valuable context.
