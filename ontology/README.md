Imagine you wanted to build a database of traits. You might start by compiling data from existing datasets, but you'd quickly find that there are many ways to name and measure the same trait, that different studies use different units, or use an outdated name for a species or taxon.

The `traits.build` package provides a workflow for harmonising data from 
disconnected primary sources and arises from the AusTraits project [austraits.org](https://austraits.org). In 2023 this package was spun out as a separate package from the [`autraits.build`](http://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits.build/) repository.

## Goals

The goals of this package are to:

1.  Enable users to create open-source, harmonised, reproducible databases from disparate datasets.
2.  Provide a fully transparent workflow, where all decisions on how the data are handled are exposed.
3.  Offer a relational database structure that fully documents the contextual data essential to interpreting ecological data.
4.  Offer a straightforward, robust template for building a trait dictionary.
5.  Offer a database structure that is flexible enough to accommodate the complexities inherent to ecological data.
6.  Offer a database structure that is underlain by a documented ontology, ensuring each database field is interpretable and interoperable with other databases and data structures.
7.  Have no dependencies on proprietary software or costs to setup and maintain (beyond person time).

To handle the harmonising of diverse data sources, we use a reproducible
workflow to implement the various changes required for each source to
reformat it suitable for incorporation in a harmonised compilation. Such changes include restructuring datasets, renaming variables, changing variable
units, changing taxon names.

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), covered in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
2. [Data science workflow management techniques](https://rstats.wtf/index.html).
3. [How to write functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) to prepare data, analyse data, and summarise results in a data analysis project.
4. [Appreciation of `traits.build`` workflow](https://traitecoevo.github.io/traits.build-book/), including the required file structure.

## Installation 

There are multiple ways to install the `traits.build` package itself, and both the latest release and the development version are available.
